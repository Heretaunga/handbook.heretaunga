	            <p>At Heretaunga College, maintaining a safe, healthy, and respectful learning environment is a top priority. In alignment with the Heretaunga College Food and Nutrition Policy, a school-wide initiative has been implemented to prohibit the possession and consumption of certain contraband items on school grounds. This policy applies to all staff, students, and visitors, and is designed to support student wellbeing and promote positive choices. Among the banned items are drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, and fizzy drinks, each of which poses risks to health, safety, or the school culture.
  				</p>
        	</div>
        	<div class="left">
            	<p>The consumption or possession of illegal substances such as drugs and alcohol is strictly forbidden. These items not only violate school rules but also New Zealand law. Any student found with such substances will be referred immediately to senior management, and appropriate disciplinary and legal procedures will follow. Cigarettes and vaping products are similarly banned, as they undermine the school’s commitment to a smoke-free environment and can have serious health consequences for both users and bystanders. Staff are trained to respond swiftly and sensitively to any incidents involving these substances, ensuring that students are supported while also held accountable.

        	<div class="right">
	            <p>	In addition to these more serious contraband items, Heretaunga College has taken a proactive stance on nutrition by becoming a fizz-free school as of 1st March 2010. Fizzy drinks are not permitted on school property, and any student or staff member found consuming or carrying them will have the item confiscated. If the drink is opened, it will be discarded; if unopened, it will be handed to senior management for collection at the end of the day. All incidents are logged in KAMAR under ‘possession of a banned product – fizz’. Persistent violations may result in a letter home to parents, seeking their support in encouraging healthier habits.
