	            <p>Heretaunga College strives to provide a wide variety of enjoyable physical opportunities for our students to participate in. The College actively works in partnership with the local community and relies on assistance from families to provide a programme that meets the needs of the students. It is encouraged that all Junior Students play at least ONE sport. It may be a winter or summer sport and either participation based or competitive. Selection or involvement in extra-curricular activities at any level, requires all students to maintain a satisfactory work ethic and standard of behaviour in the classroom. Failure to do so will result in extra-curricular opportunities being restricted.
  				</p>
        	</div>
        	<div class="left">
            	<p>Students wishing to play sport for the College must register and pay the appropriate fees. Fundraising is required for tournaments to help reduce the costs to players. Sport at Heretaunga, like other Colleges, relies on parents, staff, and students to coach and manage teams. Volunteering in sport is a rewarding experience that brings the school and community together.

            	<p><b>Fees and payments</b><br>
            		Sports registration fees are required to pay for the costs involved in sport. In general, the fees are used to pay College Sport Wellington registration fee, uniform replacement, transport in the school van and essential equipment. All costs are kept to a minimum. The College is aware that some families have financial difficulties from time to time and we do not wish to disadvantage any student wishing to play sport. If there are any students with financial difficulties, please contact the Sports Co-ordinator in confidence.

Any refunds granted will be less $10 administration fee and any other costs that may be incurred due to the withdrawal. All refunds will be credited to the student’s school account.
