	            <p><b>Elearning and the use of devices at Heretaunga College</b><br>At Heretaunga College we promote a blended learning environment, where lessons facilitated by teachers are supported by the integration of technologies, and  students are encouraged to bring and use their own devices at school. Internet-connected devices are a powerful tool. They engage learners to make connections, overcome barriers of time and distance, facilitate shared learning communities and open up new and different ways of learning.
  				</p>
        	</div>
        	<div class="left">
            	<p>These, coupled with the school’s own technologies provide a strong technological framework to enrich learning. Teachers and students make excellent use of Google apps such as Google Classroom, which promotes interactive and collaborative learning and provides great storage for a wide range of learning resources. Students can access these any time they choose. Our students are provided with the knowledge and skills to take ownership of, and to direct, their learning.

	            <p><b>Digital Citizenship</b><br>There is an increasing focus on developing the capability of young people as participants in a digital society or ‘digital citizens’ and the capability of teachers to act as guides. At Heretaunga College we endeavor to educate our students about what it means to be a good digital citizen through pastoral programmes that take place during the school year alongside assemblies. Teaching staff in all curriculum areas are responsible for ensuring that our students become good digital citizens.

            	<p>Drawing on the values and key competencies of the NZC we can begin to define a digital citizen as someone who:<br>
