	            <p>At Heretaunga College, maintaining accurate records of student attendance and movement is essential for ensuring safety and accountability across the school. All students are expected to follow the sign-in and sign-out protocol whenever they arrive late, leave early, or need to exit the school grounds during the day. This system helps staff keep track of who is on site at any given time and ensures that students are where they need to be.
  				</p>
        	</div>
        	<div class="left">
            	<p>If a student arrives late to school, they must report directly to the Student Office to sign in before heading to class. This allows their attendance to be updated in KAMAR and ensures that teachers are aware of their presence. Similarly, if a student needs to leave school early—for an appointment, illness, or any other approved reason—they must sign out through the Student Office. Students must have permission from a parent or caregiver, which can be provided via a note, phone call, or prior arrangement.
				</p>

        	<div class="right">
	            <p>	Students are not permitted to leave the school grounds during the day without signing out. This includes lunchtime or study periods unless specific permission has been granted. Failure to follow the sign-in/out procedure may result in disciplinary action, as it compromises the school’s ability to ensure student safety. Staff are trained to monitor and support this process, and students are encouraged to take responsibility for their movements.
