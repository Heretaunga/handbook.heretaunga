	            <p>At Heretaunga College, student wellbeing is a top priority, and there are a range of support systems in place to ensure every student feels safe, heard, and empowered. One of the most accessible forms of support comes from within the student body itself—our Year 12 Peer Supporters. These senior students are trained to offer guidance, encouragement, and a listening ear to younger students who may be navigating challenges or simply need someone to talk to. They’re approachable, empathetic, and understand what it’s like to be in your shoes.

            	<p>Kickstart is also always available to help students start their day on the right foot. Whether it’s helping with breakfast or just being a friendly face around campus, the Kickstart Crew plays a vital role in creating a positive and inclusive school atmosphere. Their presence reminds students that support isn’t just available, it’s woven into the everyday rhythm of school life.

	            <p>Professional support is also readily available through the school nurse and student counsellors. The nurse provides confidential health advice and care, while the counsellors are trained to help students manage emotional, social, or academic pressures. Whether you're dealing with stress, anxiety, friendship issues, or anything else that’s weighing you down, these people are here to help you work through it in a safe and supportive environment. And of course, students are always encouraged to speak with a teacher they feel comfortable with. Sometimes, just having a trusted adult to talk to can make all the difference.
