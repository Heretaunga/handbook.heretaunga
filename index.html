	    	<h1>Home</h1>
	    	<p>Heretaunga College was founded in 1954 in response to the urban growth, which accompanied the post-war boom years. It was Upper Hutt's first state secondary school. It opened with 142 third formers (Year 9’s) and seven teachers; John Thurston was the principal. By 1963 the school had 800 students and 33 teachers. John Thurston, held the position until 1968. </p>
	    	<p>Trevor Edmonds was his successor until 1974 when John Craig took up office. Brian Robb assumed the position in October 1988. Bruce Hart became Principal in 2003 and Fiona Craven was the first female Principal in 2019 when he retired. John Russell took over as Acting Principal when she left early 2024. Our current Principal, John Murdoch arrived in . There are two intermediate schools in Upper Hutt, with Maidstone Intermediate the older and larger, being the main contributor to Heretaunga College. </p>
	    	<h2>School Crest and Motto</h2>
	    	<p>The Phoenix - the story of this mythological creature, which was said to be born from the ashes of its parents, arose in Egypt. It provided an illustration for sermons and was popular with poets. Because of the stories associated with it, the Phoenix became a symbol of rebirth to new life, and was regarded as the king of the birds. When applied to the school it symbolises how the school is rejuvenated by each new intake - how it is continuously growing, and changing. </p>

	    	<p>The philosophy of the College is reflected in its crest (the Phoenix) and motto (‘Kia Hiwa Ra’ - Be Alert, Be Awake); that growth and development will occur if students are awake and alert to the many opportunities and challenges the school offers. Academic emphasis is balanced by a concern for the individual’s personal and social development. </p>

	    	<p>As part of the growth and learning process, high priority is given to preparation for employment, tertiary education and leisure; skills of self-management; respect for others; and enhancement of individual confidence and self-esteem. A positive partnership between college, home and community is developed and nurtured. </p>
